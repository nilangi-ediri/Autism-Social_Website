# 🧩 Autism Social Platform

## 📌 Overview
The **Autism Social Platform** is a web-based platform designed to support individuals involved with autistic children in South Australia. This project was developed during my first web development/software engineering internship at **CREST** (Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies). During this internship, I focused on learning and applying front-end web development skills.

## 💻 My Contribution
As a **front-end developer**, my role in this project was to develop the **information pages** of the platform, ensuring consistency in design and structure while adhering to the **React.js** framework and **Tailwind CSS**.

### 🔹 Key Tasks:
- ✅ Developed the **"Concepts and Symptoms"** information page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- 🔄 Migrated my initial static page into the **React.js framework** to maintain design consistency.
- 📄 Built the **About Page**, which included:
  - 🏗️ Implementing a dynamic **header component**.
  - 🖼️ Adding structured content sections and images.
  - 🎨 Creating **gradient lines and styled components** for visual enhancements.
  - 🔗 Linking to relevant resources and other platform pages.
- 🗂️ Designed and implemented a **Content Menu component** for better navigation.
- 🌍 Used **GitHub version control**, working with branches (`branch-nilangi` and `nilangi-react`) and collaborating with the team.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React.js**: Used to build reusable and dynamic components.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**: Styled the UI for consistency and responsiveness.
- 🏗️ **HTML & CSS**: Structured and styled content pages before transitioning to React.
- 🔄 **Git & GitHub**: Managed version control, collaboration, and deployment.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This internship provided valuable experience in:
- 🚀 Practical application of **front-end web development** concepts.
- ⚛️ Working with **React.js** and learning about component-based development.
- 🌍 Using **Git & GitHub** effectively for collaborative development.
- 🎨 Implementing **structured content layouts and UI enhancements**.
- ♿ Understanding the importance of **accessibility and usability** in social platforms.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to **Professor Ali Babar** (Head of CREST), my mentor **Hong Phuc Pham**, and my colleague **Kaito Li** for their guidance and support throughout this internship.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project was a significant milestone in my web development journey, helping me transition from theoretical learning to practical application. The experience gained has been instrumental in shaping my **front-end development skills** and preparing me for future **software engineering roles**.
